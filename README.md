## Overview

This is a challenge in which I have to create a frontend of a card for an NFT item listing. For this challenge I went forward with basic HTML & CSS.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

Initially I started with the body where I created a card class and then I gave the height and width to the body to cover the whole page. then I started with the main card. Where i gave the card a fixed size of `300px` which was an estimate from the provided challenge image. then I added all the images and icons so that I can add the arrangement and flexbox wherever its required. Then I added multiple `div` which were there to divide the card content into multiple parts. After that I went to add margin and padding to elements so that the card start to form, Also I added `border-radius` properties to image and card which gave it more similar look to the challenge. as the initial look was finalized. Then I moved to giving interactions(Hover events) to the multiple elements. finally to add the last touch I added the shadow which I generated using [Smooth Shadows](https://shadows.brumm.af/).

- CSS custom properties
